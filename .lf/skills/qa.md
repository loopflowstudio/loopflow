Use the change the way the people it is for will use it, and fix what breaks.

You are its first user. Nobody should open a demo or merge a PR and find it broken
on the first click; if they would, this step failed.

## Use the real thing

Run the real product, not its tests: the built app, the installed CLI, the live
page in a browser, the API over the network, the simulator or device. Drive it
with computer use, a browser, a terminal or whatever reaches it the way a person
would. Internal setters, test-only endpoints, mocks and fixtures do not count.

For Desktop in a headless run, follow `swift/README.md`'s Testing section:
`scripts/test_desktop.sh --filter '<affected suites>'` builds the app and CLI,
then runs model and production-view checks with WindowServer access denied.
Unset inherited `LF_*` and close stdin as described in `scripts/testing.md`.
`DesktopHeadlessTests/workStates` checks loading, unavailable, empty and selected
Work and taps the production navigation button. Report these as automated
checks, not a live-window walkthrough. Hosted window checks remain optional;
record what was not seen. With a display, `uv run python scripts/loopflow-dev.py
run-debug` builds and launches the development app; use `lf desktop state --json`
and the commands in `docs/surfaces.md` to inspect and drive it.

Getting there is your job. Build it, start its services, create accounts and
realistic data, sign in, set up whatever state a real user would already have.
When no route exists, make one. Hand back only what truly needs a person, such
as their own credentials, a physical device, a payment or a production approval,
and say exactly what that left unchecked.

Make the scenario as real as you can reach:

- Arrive the way a person arrives: a fresh install or first visit, then a
  returning user with existing data from before this change.
- Do the main job end to end, then the things people actually do: wrong input,
  empty and large data, going back, interrupting and resuming, a slow or failed
  network, two things at once.
- Check what it leaves behind as well as what it shows: files, rows, messages,
  processes, and what another part of the product now reads.
- Look at it. Read the output, check the screenshot, notice what is confusing,
  slow or ugly, not only what is wrong.

## Loopflow's local server

Build `cargo build -p loopflow --bin lf` and use that binary for branch QA.
For write scenarios, use a temporary Git repository with a local Git identity,
an isolated `HOME` and `LF_HOME`, and no inherited `LF_*` caller variables.
Set `default_agent: codex` in its `.lf/config.yaml`. Create real records with
`lf task create --title ... --json` and `lf session resume --prepare --json`;
`--prepare` creates connection data without starting a provider. For an upgrade
scenario, prepare a Session with the installed binary before opening the same
state with the branch binary.

Run `lf server run` as a child with closed stdin; get its socket from
`lf server status`. Use the revision-2 newline JSON protocol in
`rust/loopflow/src/server/README.md` over that Unix socket. Exercise Swift
encoding with the built `Loopflow` library's `ServerClientMessage` and
`ServerOperation`; this checks live interoperability, not Desktop UI behavior.
Check the resulting state through the CLI as well as the socket. Dashboard
queries accept `task:<id>`; hide/show members use that same selector.
`lf desktop layout query:<id>` already prints JSON and takes no `--json` flag.
Session pages return `entries` and `next`. Stop and reap every server child,
including on failure; no service installation is needed for this isolated run.

## Fix and repeat

Repair what breaks within the change's scope, then go through the experience
again from the start. Keep going until it works for the people it is for. A
change to what the product should be is not yours to make; describe it
instead. When asked for a read-only review, report instead of
fixing.

Run tests only where they tell you something the real path cannot reach, and
keep any you add about what a person would notice.

## Keep what you learned

How to launch and drive this product belongs in this skill. When you had to work
out a step it does not describe, or a step it describes no longer works, write
the working version here with `lf skill customize qa`, replacing what was wrong.

Show what you did in `scratch/qa.html`: each scenario, what you did, what you saw
with screenshots or transcripts, and what you fixed. Finish with what works now,
what you could not reach and why, and what is still wrong, worst first. Do not
publish, land or choose the next Graph step from here.
