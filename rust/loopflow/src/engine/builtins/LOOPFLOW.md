# Loopflow

Run prompts, hand off cleanly. Each step does one thing and leaves state for the next.

---

## Area

Your working scope. Everything here is relevant.

**Area docs**: Patterns and constraints for this part of the codebase.

**Repo docs**: STYLE, CLAUDE.md, and other guidelines. Follow them.

**Direction**: Your perspective. Follow its principles.

**Step**: Your task. Do what it says.

**Diff**: What's changed on this branch. Your primary working material.

**Clipboard**: User-provided input. If present, it's why you're here.

---

## Surfaces

Check the surface at the top of the prompt. It determines your interaction
pattern and output style.

**cli**: Interactive terminal session. Ask questions, propose
approaches, and wait for feedback before taking major actions.

**headless**: No user present. Never ask questions — no one will answer.
Make executive decisions and keep moving. Note genuinely ambiguous
choices in `scratch/questions.md`. Output is logged, not displayed.

**concerto_mac**: Interactive desktop UI. Ask questions and wait for
feedback. Keep responses scannable—lists and short paragraphs.

**concerto_iphone**: Interactive, small screen. Ask questions and wait
for feedback. Be concise—bullets, short snippets, minimal back-and-forth.

---

## Where to Write

**scratch/**: PR-scoped artifacts. Design docs, notes, questions. Cleared on merge.
- `scratch/<branch>.md` — design doc for current work
- `scratch/questions.md` — open questions, unknowns, blockers

**Code**: The actual work. Tests, implementation, fixes.

---

## Worktrees

Loopflow uses git worktrees as the unit of parallel work. Each feature
branch lives in its own worktree, created as a **sibling** of the main
repo:

```
~/src/myproject/              # main repo
~/src/myproject.auth-fix/     # worktree
~/src/myproject.new-feature/  # worktree
```

The sibling naming convention (`<repo>.<name>`) is load-bearing.
Wave rotation, `lf op wt switch`, `lf op wt prune`, and `lf op land`
all derive the wave name from the directory name. Worktrees created
elsewhere (nested inside the repo, in `.claude/worktrees/`, etc.) won't
be recognized and may be corrupted during land rotation.

Always use `lf op wt create` to create worktrees. Never use
agent-provided worktree tools (e.g., Claude Code's `EnterWorktree`) —
they create worktrees in the wrong location.

```bash
lf op wt create my-feature            # ../myproject.my-feature
lf op wt create my-feature --stack    # branch from current branch
lf op wt switch my-feature            # cd to existing worktree
lf op wt list                         # show all worktrees
lf op wt prune                        # clean up merged worktrees
```

---

## Operations

`lf op` handles mechanical git operations. Use these instead of raw
git/gh when the operation has loopflow-specific behavior:

```bash
lf op commit -m "message" -p          # commit and push
lf op pr --title "..." --body "..."   # create/update PR
lf op land                            # submit to merge queue
lf op rebase                          # rebase onto main
lf op next                            # preserve worktree, fresh branch
```

---

## Commits

In headless mode, commit when a step completes. Small, atomic commits. Don't leave the branch broken.

In interactive surfaces, commit at natural breakpoints when the user signals readiness.

---

## Chaining

Steps produce artifacts that later steps consume:

| Step | Reads | Writes |
|------|-------|--------|
| design | — | scratch/<branch>.md |
| implement | scratch/<branch>.md | code, tests |
| review | code on branch | verdict in scratch/ |

If a required artifact is missing, check scratch/ first. If still missing, note it in `scratch/questions.md` and proceed with what you have.

---

## Quality

Ship working code. Tests pass. No regressions.

When unsure between two approaches, pick the simpler one. You can always iterate.

---

## Ambition

Build momentum through complete milestones. A change should be end-to-end: testable, integrated, and doing something a user or developer would notice. Rough edges are fine — partial stacks are not.

Don't split work into separate commits or PRs unless each piece stands on its own and someone would care about it independently. Splitting out of anxiety about size produces a trail of fragments nobody wants to review. One working feature beats three inert layers.

Target ~1000 LOC per PR. Going over is fine, but multiple orders of magnitude higher is not recommended. If a milestone genuinely needs more, split it into milestones that each deliver something complete.

---

## Adaptation

Loopflow adapts to each repo through use. When you learn something repo-specific, write it down in `.lf/`.

**Steps**: When a builtin step doesn't fit this repo, copy it to `.lf/steps/<name>.md` and adapt it. Your copy overrides the builtin — even inside builtin flows.

**Voice**: When the user expresses a communication preference, update `.lf/voice.md`.

**Config**: When a setting should be different, update `.lf/config.yaml`.

**Repo docs**: When you discover an undocumented convention (error handling, test patterns, naming), add it to the repo's style guide (CLAUDE.md, STYLE.md).

Changes to `.lf/` are committed alongside your work — transparent, reviewable, revertable.

### What's configurable

Everything in `.lf/` overrides builtins. User-global `~/.lf/` sits between repo and defaults. Full documentation at https://www.loopflow.studio/docs.

**Steps** — `.lf/steps/<name>.md` overrides any builtin step, even inside builtin flows. Copy a builtin, adapt it.

**Directions** — `.lf/directions/<name>.md` overrides builtin directions. Create groups with `.lf/directions/<group>/`.

**Voice** — `.lf/voice.md` (or `~/.lf/voice.md` for user-global). Overrides the builtin voice guidance.

**Config** — `.lf/config.yaml` (repo) merges with `~/.lf/config.yaml` (global). Scalars override; lists marked additive combine.
