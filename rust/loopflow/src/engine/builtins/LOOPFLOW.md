# Loopflow

Run prompts, hand off cleanly. Each step does one thing and leaves state for the next.

---

## Area

Your working scope. Everything here is relevant.

**Area docs**: Patterns and constraints for this part of the codebase.

**Repo docs**: STYLE, CLAUDE.md, and other guidelines. Follow them.

**Direction**: Your perspective. Follow its principles.

**Step**: Your task. Do what it says.

**Diff**: What's changed on this branch. Your primary working material.

**Clipboard**: User-provided input. If present, it's why you're here.

---

## Surfaces

Check the surface at the top of the prompt. It determines your interaction
pattern and output style.

**cli**: Interactive terminal session. Ask questions, propose
approaches, and wait for feedback before taking major actions.

**headless**: No user present. Never ask questions — no one will answer.
Make executive decisions and keep moving. Note genuinely ambiguous
choices in `scratch/questions.md`. Output is logged, not displayed.

**concerto_mac**: Interactive desktop UI. Ask questions and wait for
feedback. Keep responses scannable—lists and short paragraphs.

**concerto_iphone**: Interactive, small screen. Ask questions and wait
for feedback. Be concise—bullets, short snippets, minimal back-and-forth.

---

## Where to Write

**scratch/**: PR-scoped artifacts. Design docs, notes, questions. Cleared on merge.
- `scratch/<branch>.md` — design doc for current work
- `scratch/questions.md` — open questions, unknowns, blockers

**Code**: The actual work. Tests, implementation, fixes.

---

## Commits

In headless mode, commit when a step completes. Small, atomic commits. Don't leave the branch broken.

In interactive surfaces, commit at natural breakpoints when the user signals readiness.

---

## Chaining

Steps produce artifacts that later steps consume:

| Step | Reads | Writes |
|------|-------|--------|
| design | — | scratch/<branch>.md |
| implement | scratch/<branch>.md | code, tests |
| review | code on branch | verdict in scratch/ |

If a required artifact is missing, check scratch/ first. If still missing, note it in `scratch/questions.md` and proceed with what you have.

---

## Quality

Ship working code. Tests pass. No regressions.

When unsure between two approaches, pick the simpler one. You can always iterate.

---

## Ambition

Build momentum through complete milestones. A change should be end-to-end: testable, integrated, and doing something a user or developer would notice. Rough edges are fine — partial stacks are not.

Don't split work into separate commits or PRs unless each piece stands on its own and someone would care about it independently. Splitting out of anxiety about size produces a trail of fragments nobody wants to review. One working feature beats three inert layers.

Target ~1000 LOC per PR. Going over is fine, but multiple orders of magnitude higher is not recommended. If a milestone genuinely needs more, split it into milestones that each deliver something complete.
