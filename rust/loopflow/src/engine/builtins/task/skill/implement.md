Turn the design doc into working code.

## Orientation

Before starting, orient yourself in this branch:

- Read `scratch/` — design docs and notes for the current work live here
  (`scratch/<branch>.md` is this PR's design; `scratch/questions.md` holds open
  questions and assumptions).
- Read wave/PM context only when the seed names the exact wave, task, project,
  or a concrete coordination question; never infer it or repair access as a
  prerequisite.
- Read the repo's agent doc (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) for conventions.

Write design artifacts, notes, and open questions under `scratch/`. Don't
re-derive what these already record.

## Goal

Working code with rough edges beats perfect code that took too long.

Produce a first draft quickly. Polish cleans it up. You can be re-invoked if needed. Don't block on ambiguity—make the simplest choice and keep moving.

## Workflow

The design doc and style guides are in your context.

1. **Understand the design**
   The design doc has data structures, function signatures, constraints, and a "done when" check.

2. **Implement**
   - Data structures first—get the core types right
   - Functions one at a time, following the signatures
   - Match existing patterns in the codebase
   - A large design proceeds in slices—one coherent piece at a time, each
     checked against the design doc—but the branch ships as one PR. Don't
     stage the landing with flags, v2s, or setups nothing uses yet.

3. **Verify**
   - Run the smallest behavioral test that proves the behavior you changed
   - Run the "done when" check from the design doc
   - Do not run an affected-suite or full-repository gate here; gate and CI own
     those broader proofs

## Rules

**Match existing patterns.** Find similar code nearby and match its style. If the codebase uses `@dataclass`, use `@dataclass`. If it uses type hints, use type hints.

**Stay in scope.** Implement exactly what the design describes. Scope creep goes in `scratch/questions.md`, not the code.

**Tests prove it works.** Add tests for user-visible behavior. Don't test implementation details. Assert on results, not mock calls.

## Wave context

If `<lf:wave>` is present, check `wave/<wave>/GOAL.md` and `MEMORY.md` in docs:

- Follow the wave's intent and principles during implementation
- Respect decisions and constraints recorded in `MEMORY.md`
- Note drift from wave constraints in `scratch/questions.md`

## When the design is wrong

If the design doc is unclear, make the simplest choice and move on. Note your assumption in `scratch/questions.md`.

If implementation reveals a design flaw, note it but keep going. The design was scaffolding—diverge when reality demands it.

## Adaptation

If you had to discover a convention that wasn't documented — error handling pattern, test structure, naming style, import conventions — add it to the repo's style guide (CLAUDE.md, STYLE.md) so the next session doesn't have to rediscover it.
