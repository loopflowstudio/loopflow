# LOO-809: remote attach tickets

Implement the [remote attach contract](../rust/loopflow/src/server/README.md#remote-attach-contract),
linked from `docs/server.md`. This checkout contains the planned contract only.

The listener, mobile settings and bulk protocol are outside this Task.
The contract remains marked planned until implemented. Current local tickets
consume on every attempt and expire using `Instant`; remote identity and expiry
across host sleep are not implemented here.

## Transport dependency — November 10, 2026 UTC

The inspected PR #1812 head is
`73826eaf005d00e1aeae26dd1cf2a91cf5f72981`. It supplies
`Admission::Remote { node: String, user: u64 }` through
`server/mobile.rs::permits_peer`: Tailscale WhoIs `Node.StableID` and
`UserProfile.ID`, checked against `Node.User`. Both WebSocket paths authenticate
through `host.permits`: `/v1/machine` for control and `/v1/ticket` for redemption.
Terminal redemption answers `bridged {owner_lf_process_id}`, matching this
Task's planned wire contract; bulk redemption answers `admitted`.

That revision shares `server/ticket.rs` between terminal and bulk transfer,
leaves foreign attempts unconsumed and expires tickets with `Instant`, contrary to this
Task's consume-on-attempt and host-sleep requirements. It has already removed
the UID-only store. `Admission::Local` follows a same-effective-UID check on
every Unix socket connection. The shared-store tests cover bulk single use,
foreign attempts remaining redeemable, expiry and sweeping; they do not cover
the terminal consume-on-attempt requirement.

At November 10 08:16 UTC, GitHub reports PR #1812 open and unmerged at the same
head, with merge conflicts reported. Freshly fetched main is
`9c3403a885356276c52c345b426dc9d7b4714be7`; both transport files remain absent.
`lf task status LOO-718 --json` still places the transport Task at `feature/demo`,
with PR #1812 open and settlement not armed.
Implementation and remote acceptance remain blocked on LOO-718 landing.
Landing that separate PR is outside this Task's scope. No product decision is
missing.

to older status reads.

## Delete — do not maintain

Integrating the inspected transport removes `server/service.rs::Ticket` and
`Tickets`, the current UID-only store. Use its shared `server/ticket.rs`
authority without retaining a second store. Carry forward the behavior covered
by `a_ticket_opens_one_bridge_for_its_user_within_its_lifetime`: identity,
consume-on-attempt, single use, expiry and sweeping. Add missing terminal cases
to the shared-store tests; retain its bulk cases, service-level bridge tests and
wire fixtures for the surviving protocol.

## Remaining implementation

Recheck the landed revision before integrating. Restore terminal consume-on-attempt
in the shared store without changing bulk redemption policy. Replace ticket timing
with `SystemTime` so the 60-second deadline includes host sleep; leave unrelated
throttles on `Instant`. Retain the transport's watch resumption.

After integration, update the docs' planned/local-only wording to match the
implemented endpoint.

## Remaining acceptance

Exercise the remote attach contract through authenticated client and bridge
connections: matching node/user succeeds once; a different node, different user,
or local/remote mismatch fails and consumes the terminal ticket. Check expiry at
60 seconds with a clock advance representing host sleep, expired-ticket sweeping,
and unchanged bulk-transfer redemption behavior. Local UID tests alone cannot
satisfy these checks.

Desktop review and opening results are in `questions.md`.

`git diff --check` — clean; `lf context` — within both scratch limits. Prose only;
no build or tests needed.
