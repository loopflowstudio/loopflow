# LOO-811 validation choices

2026-11-08: Use the existing `tests/e2e/claude_shared_home.py` with installed lf,
real Claude, synthetic logins, a temporary provider home and local inference
endpoint for reversible switch/hold checks. Shared production logins have open
conversations, so do not switch, refresh or restart them for a probe. These
checks establish native client/Keychain behavior, not provider token rotation.

2026-11-08 iteration direction retains USER plus one legacy item after every
switch; the earlier concept-review alternatives do not supersede it. Reversible
choice for services with more than two items: select the lexically first non-USER
account, independent of native lookup order. Update at most two items; third-item
behavior stays separate from the two-item guarantee. Existing unsafe account-name
filtering in the stdin writer remains unchanged in this focused repair.

2026-11-08 QA: exercise the repaired CLI with a temporary scoped Keychain service
and a read-only reload marker. Use synthetic accounts for supplemental native
checks; seeded partial state does not establish a rejected native write or live
login acceptance. Keep the installed pair and production conversations untouched.

2026-11-09 implementation assumption: keep Codex's native terminal alive while
replacing only its private app-server; the disposable probe retains and submits
a draft across that replacement. Do not reuse `resume --account` for automatic
recovery: it ends the native client. Pending requests and uncertain dispatch wait.
The provider-generation/exit-record handoff and turn-arrival race remain a design
conflict to resolve before automatic recovery can be implemented or published.
