The app appends to `<Home>/desktop-cache/timings/launches.ndjson` and
`reads.ndjson` whenever it runs outside a test mode; `timings.py` only reads
them. Each file keeps its newest half past 256 KB. Lines hold durations, `lf`
subcommand words, the workspace part and the app version: no arguments, output
or error text. Delete the directory to start over.

| Row | Milliseconds from kernel process start to |
|---|---|
| `pre_main` | `LoopflowApp.init` |
| `restored` | the saved workspace looked up (`saved workspace: hit/miss`) |
| `first_frame` | the first window's content committed to the render server |
| `usable_saved` / `usable_fresh` | outline rows observed, then the next main-queue callback; split by whether any part was saved text |
| `fresh` | every part of the workspace read by this launch |

`lf read` and `refresh` rows are durations of one subprocess read and one
planning or Sessions refresh, with failures counted apart. Reads have no
timeout, so a hung read shows as a launch that never reached `fresh`. A launch
still running, or quit early, is counted the same way. `first_frame` is a
commit, not on-glass presentation; CPU, memory and main-thread stalls are
`record_live.py`'s.

`record_live.py record` attaches to the app you are already using (`Loopflow` from
/Applications, or `LoopflowMac` from `swift/.build`), waits `--seconds`, then writes
one directory: `signposts.ndjson` (the app's own `studio.loopflow`/`perf` intervals
from the unified log), `hitches.trace` plus exported `hitches.xml` and
`potential-hangs.xml` (Instruments' Animation Hitches template attached to the pid),
`rss.jsonl` (one `ps` sample per second), and `report.md`/`report.json` with
per-interval p50/p95/max, superseded counts, hitch ms/s, hangs and RSS growth.
Nothing is sent anywhere; delete the directory when done. Use the app normally
while it records — the intervals are named after what you did.

| Interval | Begins | Ends |
|---|---|---|
| `cold_start` | `LoopflowApp.init` (message carries `pre_main_ms`) | next main-queue callback after non-empty rows are observed |
| `workspace_current` | `LoopflowApp.init` | every part of the workspace was read by this launch, none shown from the saved workspace |
| `hierarchy_interaction` | fold, presentation, filter keystroke, repository switch | next main-queue callback after changed rows are observed |
| `task_workspace_ready` | `scenario=wave` / `task`: selection; `scenario=session`: Session opened | next main-queue callback after detail/focus is observed |
| `retained_workspace_action` | collapse, expand, focus or restore of a retained pane | next main-queue callback after the workspace observes the layout change |
| `lf` | one `lf` subprocess read (message = verb) | stdout decoded |
| `markdown_parse` | one Description/Comment parse | blocks built |
| `terminal_key_to_draw` | key press in a Ghostty pane | next display-link draw |

The navigation intervals end in a queued main-thread callback. They measure
scheduling after the view observes a change, not completed layout, drawing or
presentation. No one-frame presentation bound is established. Instruments
measures hitches and hangs separately for the same period. An interval ended `superseded` means a newer interaction replaced it
before it finished; the report counts those separately for each scenario, even
when none finished. Missing trace tables are unmeasured (`null` in JSON), not
zero hitches or hangs.

`xctrace` needs Xcode; `--no-xctrace` still gives intervals and RSS. `leaks <pid>`
against the signed app reports "not debuggable" and sees read-only memory only;
for a full leak graph use the dev build.

An in-process XCTest harness measuring the same intervals on fixture data
(`XCTOSSignpostMetric`, clock and memory metrics, 4 Waves × 50 Tasks) is
LOO-300's work; it is not in this tree.

`20260924-capture-input/` is the earlier bitmap-capture/OCR baseline for
`scripts/desktop_performance.py`; its README explains why it is not comparable
with signpost intervals.

`launch.py run` copies the Home's database with SQLite's backup, builds the
release binary into its own app bundle (`com.loopflow.mac.bench`), and opens it
in the background: three launches with no saved workspace, twenty with one, and
three whose planning and Sessions reads fail. The bundle's `lf` forwards the
startup reads to the installed `lf` under the copy and refuses every other
command, so no helper, Session or repair starts. Each sample is the app's own
launch journal plus `ps` RSS and CPU time at the endpoint and the `lf` processes
it started. `--built` reuses the bundle already in `--work`; `--home <other
work>/home` copies another run's Home, so a baseline and a candidate read the
same data. It needs a logged-in desktop; OS file caches stay warm, and
main-thread stalls are `record_live.py`'s. `20261004-launch-rendered/` compares
a baseline and a candidate; `20261005-first-render/` alternates the two in
rounds so both see the same host load.

`desktop_performance.py write-visible` opens one window on a private Home
through the real `lf monitor workspace --watch` reader, then commits from
`sqlite3`: a Task created and renamed, a Session created, renamed and completed.
Each interval runs from the writer's exit to the row read back from a captured
bitmap; `write_ms` is recorded beside it. The Home must be a copy (it refuses
the one in use) already at the schema of the `--lf` being measured, and a
current Task in `--repo` is the model for the new one. Written Tasks are
deleted after each attempt; completed benchmark Sessions stay in the copy. It
needs a logged-in desktop. Each write waits for an idle reader, so it does not
sample a commit landing behind a reading already in flight.

`startup.py` measures when the model first holds outline content for an
uncached launch, a launch with a saved workspace, a saved launch whose reads
fail, and a second window in the process that saved. Twenty samples by default,
with `lf` reads counted before usable and until settled. It runs without a
display, so it reports no first frame, CPU, memory or stalls;
`20261004-startup-inprocess/` is its receipt.
