# RLM: Recursive Language Model

Spawn sub-agents to process inputs beyond your context window. Split, delegate, aggregate.

---

## When to Use

When exhaustive analysis requires more data than fits in context:
- Files too large to read at once
- Many files across a broad area
- Logs, transcripts, or documents requiring complete coverage

Don't use RLM for tasks where reading a few key files is sufficient. Use it when partial reading would miss things.

---

## Pattern

Every RLM task follows the same four steps regardless of environment.

```
You (parent agent)
├── 1. Examine: check size, decide whether to split
├── 2. Split: divide into chunks at natural boundaries
├── 3. Delegate: spawn one sub-agent per chunk
│   ├── Sub-agent 1 → chunk A → result A
│   ├── Sub-agent 2 → chunk B → result B
│   └── Sub-agent 3 → chunk C → result C
└── 4. Aggregate: combine results, answer original question
```

Sub-agents can themselves recurse — if a chunk is still too large, the sub-agent splits further.

### 1. Examine

Check size and structure before deciding to split.

```bash
wc -l large_file.txt
find src/api/ -name "*.rs" | wc -l
```

If it fits in context, just read it. RLM adds overhead — only use it when you'd miss things otherwise.

### 2. Split

Divide at natural boundaries — file boundaries, function/class boundaries, paragraph breaks, or fixed line counts for uniform data.

### 3. Delegate

Spawn one sub-agent per chunk. Use whatever mechanism your environment provides.

#### Agent tool (Claude Code)

If you have access to an Agent tool, use it directly. Embed the chunk in the prompt. Launch multiple sub-agents in parallel by making multiple Agent calls in a single response.

Use a cheap, fast model (`haiku`) for chunk processing:

```
Agent tool call:
  description: "Scan chunk 1 for endpoints"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: "haiku"
  prompt: |
    Find all public API endpoints in this code.
    Return each as: METHOD /path — description

    <code>
    [chunk content]
    </code>
```

Launch all chunks in parallel — independent Agent calls in the same message execute concurrently. Each sub-agent gets an isolated context window.

To aggregate, read the returned results from each Agent call and synthesize.

#### Shell — `lf -b` (Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, terminal)

If you don't have an Agent tool, use shell to write chunks to disk and run `lf` in batch mode.

```bash
mkdir -p .lf/rlm/chunks .lf/rlm/results .lf/steps

# Split the input
split -l 500 large_file.txt .lf/rlm/chunks/chunk_

# Create a step per chunk
for f in .lf/rlm/chunks/chunk_*; do
  name=$(basename "$f")
  cat > ".lf/steps/rlm-${name}.md" <<EOF
---
agent: claude:haiku
---
Find all public API endpoints in this code.
Write each as METHOD /path to .lf/rlm/results/${name}.out

<code>
$(cat "$f")
</code>
EOF
done

# Run in parallel (up to 10 concurrent)
ls .lf/steps/rlm-*.md | xargs -P 10 -I {} sh -c \
  'lf "$(basename {} .md)" -b'
```

To aggregate:

```bash
cat .lf/rlm/results/*.out | sort -u > .lf/rlm/combined.txt
```

Then read the combined file and answer the original question.

Sub-agents spawned via `lf -b` get full loopflow context (repo docs, style guide, area docs). Recursion depth increments automatically.

### 4. Aggregate

Combine sub-agent results into a final answer. Look for:
- Duplicates across chunks (deduplicate)
- Items that span chunk boundaries (reconcile)
- Patterns only visible across the full set (synthesize)

---

## Recursion Depth

Depth prevents infinite recursion. Each nested `lf` invocation auto-increments `RLM_DEPTH`. Check before spawning sub-agents that might themselves recurse.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `RLM_DEPTH` | 0 | Current recursion depth (auto-incremented by `lf`) |
| `RLM_MAX_DEPTH` | 3 | Maximum allowed depth |
| `RLM_MAX_PARALLEL` | 10 | Suggested max concurrent sub-agents |

When using the Agent tool, environment variables don't propagate — track depth yourself. If you've already split once, tell sub-agents not to recurse further unless the chunk is genuinely too large.

---

## Tips

- **Cheap models for sub-agents.** Use `haiku` or `sonnet` — chunk processing is mechanical, not creative.
- **Chunk at natural boundaries.** File, function, paragraph. Don't split mid-sentence or mid-function.
- **Focused instructions.** "Find X in this code" not "analyze this code." Each sub-agent does one thing.
- **Don't over-split.** 5–20 chunks is typical. 100 chunks means your task needs a different approach.
- **Clean up.** `rm -rf .lf/rlm/ .lf/steps/rlm-*` when done.

Run mode is headless. No user is present. Never ask questions or wait for input — no one will answer.

Do the work. Make executive decisions where needed — pick the simpler choice and keep moving. You can always be corrected in review.

If something is genuinely ambiguous, note your assumption in `scratch/questions.md` and proceed with your best judgment. Do not stop.

No rendering environment. Output is logged, not displayed.

The step.

<lf:step:demo>
Walk the human through experiencing what changed, then decide together what's next.

## Orientation

Before starting, orient yourself in this branch:

- Read `scratch/` — design docs and notes for the current work live here
  (`scratch/<branch>.md` is this PR's design; `scratch/questions.md` holds open
  questions and assumptions).
- If a `wave/<name>/` directory matches this work, skim its roadmap and items.
- Read the repo's agent doc (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) for conventions.

Write design artifacts, notes, and open questions under `scratch/`. Don't
re-derive what these already record.

## Voice

The human is context-switching back into this work. Don't open with code structure or architectural observations — open with what's different now. What can they see, run, or feel that they couldn't before?

Vary the entry point. A demo that opens the same way every time ("Let me walk you through what changed...") stops being a demo and becomes a report. Lead with whatever is most alive in this change.

## Opening

Before any code discussion, ground the human in the experience:

1. **What's new** — one or two sentences. What exists now that didn't before, in user-facing terms.
2. **How to see it** — the command to run, the page to open, the flow to trigger. Be specific enough that they can do it right now.
3. **What to look for** — the moment where the change becomes visible. "You'll see X where there used to be Y" or "Try Z and watch what happens."

If the design doc in `scratch/` has a "Done when" section with a verification command, start there.

## Demo

Run things. Show output. Let the human react.

The demo is the center of the session, not a preamble to code review. Spend time here. If something surprising happens — good or bad — follow that thread.

For UI changes: launch the environment (check `scripts/` for existing launchers like `concerto-dev.py`). Print a short walkthrough checklist, then let the human explore.

For CLI/library changes: run the commands, show the output. Before/after when it helps.

For API changes: show example calls and responses.

Pause after the demo. Ask what they noticed. Their reaction shapes the rest of the session.

## After the demo

The human's experience determines what happens next:

**If it works and feels right** — move toward shipping. Light code discussion if the human wants it. Don't force a code review when the demo landed clean.

**If something's off** — dig into why. This might lead to code, or it might lead to a design conversation. Follow the thread.

**If they want to see the code** — walk through the diff, focusing on decisions that connect to what they just experienced. "The reason it behaves like X is because of this structure." Code in service of understanding, not code for its own sake.

## Collaborative execution

During the session:
- Fix clear wins directly. Small improvements that are obviously better — just do them.
- Co-design when the human spots something they want different. Their experience of the demo is primary data.
- If fixes or improvements accumulate, offer packaging options:
  - **Ship as-is** — demo was clean, ship it.
  - **Quick fixes** — address what came up in the demo, then ship.
  - **Rethink** — something fundamental felt wrong, go back to design.

## Verification

**Default: write or extend a Python script in `scripts/` (no bash).** Check `scripts/` first — reuse or extend an existing script if one covers similar ground. The bar: one command to run, one working environment, start clicking.

When a script isn't needed (pure backend, no observable change), say so — and consider whether this change should have been routed to `code-review` instead.

## Guidance

- The demo is the review. Don't bolt on a separate "now let's review the code" phase unless the human asks for it.
- Quote the diff when discussing code, but only in service of explaining behavior the human just saw.
- If the change has metrics (performance, accuracy, latency), show the numbers during the demo, not in a separate section.
- Read every changed file to understand the full picture, but present through the lens of experience, not file-by-file.

## Adaptation

When demo patterns emerge for this repo (specific launch scripts, common verification flows, preferred demo formats), update `.lf/steps/` or repo docs so future demos start prepared.
